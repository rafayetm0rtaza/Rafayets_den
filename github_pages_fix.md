# GitHub Pages Build Fix

The issue with your GitHub Pages build is that there's a reference to a Git submodule with the path 'Rafayets_den', but there's no corresponding entry in a `.gitmodules` file.

## Steps to Fix the Issue

1. First, you need to clone the repository locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rafayetm0rtaza/Rafayets_den.git
cd Rafayets_den
```

2. Remove the submodule reference:
```bash
git rm --cached Rafayets_den
```
(If this command gives an error, the submodule might be registered in Git's config files but not in the working directory)

3. Commit and push the changes:
```bash
git commit -m "Remove incorrect submodule reference"
git push
```

## Setting Up GitHub Actions Workflow

After removing the submodule reference, create a GitHub Actions workflow file to properly deploy your site:

1. Create a directory for the workflow:
```bash
mkdir -p .github/workflows
```

2. Create a file named `.github/workflows/pages.yml` with the following content:
```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: ["main"]
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: false

jobs:
  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          submodules: false  # Explicitly disable submodules
      - name: Setup Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v4
      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: '.'
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

3. Commit and push the workflow file:
```bash
git add .github/workflows/pages.yml
git commit -m "Add GitHub Pages deployment workflow"
git push
```

## GitHub Pages Settings

Additionally, make sure your GitHub Pages settings are correctly configured:

1. Go to your repository's Settings tab
2. In the left sidebar, click on "Pages"
3. Under "Build and deployment", select "GitHub Actions" as the source
4. This will use the workflow file we've created to deploy your site
