# This is a temporary file that indicates we should remove any submodule references
# The issue in your GitHub Pages build is that your repository has a reference to a Git submodule
# with the path 'Rafayets_den', but there's no corresponding entry in a .gitmodules file.
# 
# To fix this issue, you'll need to:
# 1. Clone the repository locally
# 2. Remove the submodule reference with git commands
# 3. Push the changes back to GitHub
#
# Local commands to run:
# git clone https://github.com/rafayetm0rtaza/Rafayets_den.git
# cd Rafayets_den
# git rm --cached Rafayets_den (if this directory exists)
# git commit -m "Remove incorrect submodule reference"
# git push
